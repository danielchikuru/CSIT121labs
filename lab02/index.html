<h2>The Best Snickerdoodle Cookies</h2>
<h3>By Jane Smith</h3>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar, for rolling</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, for rolling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
<li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.</li>
<li>Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix until just combined.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon for rolling.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat.</li>
<li>Place the coated balls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are lightly golden.</li>
<li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is my favorite recipe because these snickerdoodle cookies have the perfect balance of sweetness and warmth from the cinnamon. They're soft, buttery, and absolutely delicious!</p>
