    <h1> Findings </h1>
    <p> Even though it existed before the pandemic, remote jobs really grew in popularity during the pandemic.<br>
        I would really like to have a remote job that allows me to work from home, and I was surprised to see that most of my researches<br>
        lead me to remote jobs; however, they are high jobs that demands high level skills and a lot of years of experience. I understand how experience<br>
        plays a key role in those jobs, but can a new hired with no experience have a chance to learn?</p>
